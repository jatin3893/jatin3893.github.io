## Starting with who I am:

My name is Jatin Parekh. I am currently in pursuit of my 4th Year Computer Science undergraduate degree from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus (a.k.a BITS Goa :D ).

## So what do I do?

Apart from appearing for college exams and attending lectures, I like working with Computer Graphics. I work with OpenGL as well as 3D Modelling softwares like Maya, 3DS Max or Blender. I also have a little experience in Computer Vision using OpenCV.

Currently, I am an R&D intern at DreamWorks Animation in India, which is more commonly known as DreamWorks Dedicated Unit (DDU). Over here, I have been working on their proprietary and other tools like AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap, D3 and Tornado to create a web application for the developers at DDU.

I love working with C and C++. I have also used Qt for GUI based C++ applications and though I have no experience in Python, I have recently started using PyQt for a small application. I have also participated in Google Summer of Code 2014 as a student for The Visualization Toolkit.

Apart from this, I am an active member at Abhigyaan which is a group of students of BITS-Pilani, Goa Campus who work towards teaching the uneducated on-campus staff like mess workers, security guards and their children. I really enjoy teaching, be it my students at Abhigyaan or my classmates or juniors.

## What am I doing here?

Apart from keeping an account of activities that I do so that it can be utilized by other people who are trying to do something similar, I use this place as a platform to share my experiences as an Abhigyaan member and a Computers and Programming enthusiast.

## How is this useful for you?

Well, you are here. So, it definitely means you are looking for something. If it is already here and youâ€™ve found it useful, then please do let me know! If it is not, then do take some time out and tell me about it. I might just get a chance to explore something new, because of you.
