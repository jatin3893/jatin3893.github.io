<h2 id="starting-with-who-i-am:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">Starting with who I am:</h2>

<p>My name is Jatin Parekh. I am currently in pursuit of my 4th Year Computer Science undergraduate degree from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus (a.k.a BITS Goa :D ).</p>

<h2 id="so-what-do-i-do:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">So what do I do?</h2>

<p>Apart from appearing for college exams and attending lectures, I like working with Computer Graphics. I work with OpenGL as well as 3D Modelling softwares like Maya, 3DS Max or Blender. I also have a little experience in Computer Vision using OpenCV.</p>

<p>Currently, I am an R&amp;D intern at DreamWorks Animation in India, which is more commonly known as DreamWorks Dedicated Unit (DDU). Over here, I have been working on their proprietary and other tools like AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap, D3 and Tornado to create a web application for the developers at DDU.</p>

<p>I love working with C and C++. I have also used Qt for GUI based C++ applications and though I have no experience in Python, I have recently started using PyQt for a small application. I have also participated in Google Summer of Code 2014 as a student for The Visualization Toolkit.</p>

<p>Apart from this, I am an active member at Abhigyaan which is a group of students of BITS-Pilani, Goa Campus who work towards teaching the uneducated on-campus staff like mess workers, security guards and their children. I really enjoy teaching, be it my students at Abhigyaan or my classmates or juniors.</p>

<h2 id="what-am-i-doing-here:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">What am I doing here?</h2>

<p>Apart from keeping an account of activities that I do so that it can be utilized by other people who are trying to do something similar, I use this place as a platform to share my experiences as an Abhigyaan member and a Computers and Programming enthusiast.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-this-useful-for-you:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">How is this useful for you?</h2>

<p>Well, you are here. So, it definitely means you are looking for something. If it is already here and youâ€™ve found it useful, then please do let me know! If it is not, then do take some time out and tell me about it. I might just get a chance to explore something new, because of you.</p>
